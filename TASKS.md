## Known Issues

### üö® APK Build Failure
**Status**: BLOCKED  
**Issue**: sqflite plugin causes Gradle build failure with "Cannot query the value of this provider because it has no value available"

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- sqflite_android plugin has Gradle provider configuration issue
- Java 21 / Gradle 8.5 / AGP 8.2.0 compatibility resolved
- Newer sqflite versions require Dart 3.8+ but Flutter 3.29.0 only supports Dart 3.7
- Current stable sqflite 2.4.1 still has provider configuration issues

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Updated Gradle wrapper to 8.5, AGP to 8.2.0, Kotlin to 1.9.10 ‚úÖ
- Tried dependency overrides for sqflite components ‚ùå
- Used compatible sqflite versions (2.4.1) ‚ùå
- Attempted ARM64-only builds ‚ùå

**Current Workaround**: App functions correctly in debug mode with `flutter run`

**Next Steps**: 
- Monitor sqflite plugin updates for Gradle provider fixes
- Consider alternative local database solutions (drift, hive)
- Test with Flutter 3.30+ when available (may support newer Dart SDK)
