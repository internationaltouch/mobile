# FIT Mobile App

FIT has identified a requirement for a mobile app to power our international events.

As a not-for-profit organisation we are seeking individuals or agencies to assist us with this app development on a voluntary basis.

## Our requirements

You must be an experienced mobile app developer and adept at creating apps for iOS and Android from a single code base. You should also be experienced with REST and local storage, while we need user interface design experts too.

The project will be an open-source effort, with all development occurring on our GitHub space.

## What we can offer you

In return for your time and expertise, we can provide some recognition for your work on our digital assets and at our international events, which include the quadrennial Touch World Cup, and our regional tournaments such as the Asian Touch Cup and European Touch Championships.
