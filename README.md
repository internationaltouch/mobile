- **Division**: Age/gender categories within events
- **Fixture**: Match details with teams, times, and results
- **Ladder**: Tournament standings with statistics
- **NewsItem**: News feed content

### Static Data
Currently uses static demo data via `DataService`. In production, this would be replaced with REST API calls to live tournament data.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for:

- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Formatting, linting, and analysis
- üß™ **Testing**: Automated test suite execution
- üì¶ **Build Artifacts**: 
  - Android APK and App Bundle
  - iOS IPA (signed/unsigned for testing)

### Workflows

#### Main CI/CD (`flutter.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to `main`/`develop` branches, PRs to `main`
- **Runs**: Tests, analysis, Android builds, iOS builds
- **Artifacts**: `android-apk`, `android-aab`, `ios-ipa`

#### iOS Build (`ios-build.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Pull requests only
- **Runs**: iOS-specific builds with code signing support
- **Artifacts**: `ios-ipa`, `ios-build-report`
- **Features**: Automatic device installation instructions

### Artifacts
Download build artifacts from GitHub Actions runs:
- `android-apk`: Android APK for direct installation
- `android-aab`: Android App Bundle for Play Store
- `ios-ipa`: iOS IPA for testing (signed if secrets configured)
- `ios-build-report`: Device installation instructions and build details

### iOS Code Signing
For signed iOS builds, configure the following repository secrets:
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`: Base64-encoded P12 certificate
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: Certificate password
- `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`: Base64-encoded provisioning profile
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Apple Developer Team ID

See [IOS_CODE_SIGNING.md](IOS_CODE_SIGNING.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Adding New Features

2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`
4. Submit pull request

### Code Style
- Follow [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
