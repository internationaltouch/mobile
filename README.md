# FIT Mobile App

FIT has identified a requirement for a mobile app to power our international events.

While our event schedule is still on hold for now, as a not-for-profit organization we are seeking an individual or agency to assist us with this app development on a voluntary basis.

## Our requirements

We’re interested in collaborating with either individuals or agencies who can sponsor the project.

You must be an experienced mobile app developer and adept at creating apps for iOS and Android from a single code base. You should also be experienced with REST and local storage, while we need user interface design experts too.

The project will be an open-source effort, with all development occurring on our GitHub space and collaboration using various online tools that you will probably find familiar after a year like no other.

## What we can offer you

In return for your time and expertise, we can provide some recognition for your work on our digital assets and at our international events, which include the quadrennial Touch World Cup, and our regional tournaments such as the Asian Cup and European Championships.

## Apply now

If you’re interested in this opportunity to collaborate with our rapidly expanding sport, please email technology@internationaltouch.org to connect with our project manager.

Applicants should link to examples of their prior work and provide a brief curriculum vitae that outlines your relevant skills and experience.
